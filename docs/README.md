# Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the SEO Tool project.

## Available Documentation

- [Tasks](./tasks.md) - A comprehensive checklist of improvement tasks for the project
- [Naming Conventions](./naming-conventions.md) - Guidelines for consistent naming throughout the codebase

## Naming Conventions

The [Naming Conventions](./naming-conventions.md) document outlines the consistent naming patterns to be used throughout the codebase. It covers:

1. File naming (kebab-case)
2. Feature-specific prefixes (using directory structure for namespacing)
3. Component naming (PascalCase)
4. Hook naming (camelCase with "use" prefix)
5. Function and variable naming (camelCase)
6. Type and interface naming (PascalCase)
7. Constants (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE)

Following these conventions will help maintain consistency and readability across the codebase.

## Implementation Status

The naming conventions have been defined and documented, but implementation across the codebase is still in progress. The implementation plan includes:

1. Updating file names to remove feature-specific prefixes
2. Updating component names to use PascalCase
3. Updating hook names to follow the React convention
4. Updating function and variable names to use camelCase
5. Updating type and interface names to use PascalCase
6. Updating constants to use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
7. Updating import/export statements to reflect the new naming conventions

This work will be done incrementally to minimize disruption to the development workflow.
