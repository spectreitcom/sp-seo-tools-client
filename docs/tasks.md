   - [X] Create reusable error boundary components
   - [ ] Add global error tracking and reporting

2. [ ] Enhance state management
   - [ ] Evaluate if more state should be moved to Zustand for global management
   - [ ] Create a more structured approach to local state management
   - [ ] Consider implementing context providers for feature-specific state

3. [X] Improve project structure
   - [X] Organize components by feature/domain in addition to type
   - [X] Create a clear separation between UI components and container components
   - [X] Implement a consistent folder structure within feature directories

4. [ ] Implement a comprehensive caching strategy
   - [ ] Review and optimize React Query caching configurations
   - [ ] Implement proper cache invalidation strategies
   - [ ] Add prefetching for common user flows

5. [ ] Enhance API layer

   - [ ] Implement request/response interceptors for common operations
   - [ ] Add retry logic for failed requests

## Code Quality Improvements

6. [ ] Improve component reusability
   - [ ] Extract common UI patterns into reusable components
   - [ ] Create a component library with documentation
   - [ ] Implement consistent prop interfaces across similar components

7. [ ] Enhance type safety
   - [ ] Add more specific TypeScript types instead of using any
   - [ ] Create utility types for common patterns
   - [ ] Ensure consistent use of type definitions across the codebase

8. [ ] Implement comprehensive testing
   - [ ] Add unit tests for utility functions and hooks
   - [ ] Implement component tests with React Testing Library
   - [ ] Add integration tests for key user flows
   - [ ] Set up end-to-end testing with Cypress or Playwright

9. [ ] Improve code maintainability
   - [X] Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to functions and components
   - [X] Implement consistent naming conventions
   - [ ] Reduce component complexity by breaking down large components

10. [ ] Optimize performance
    - [ ] Implement code splitting for routes
    - [ ] Add memoization for expensive calculations
    - [ ] Optimize rendering with useMemo and useCallback
    - [ ] Implement virtualization for long lists

## User Experience Improvements

11. [ ] Enhance loading states
    - [ ] Create consistent loading indicators
    - [ ] Implement skeleton screens for better perceived performance
    - [ ] Add progressive loading for large data sets

12. [ ] Improve error feedback
    - [ ] Create user-friendly error messages
    - [ ] Implement inline validation for forms
    - [ ] Add recovery options for common error scenarios

13. [ ] Enhance accessibility
